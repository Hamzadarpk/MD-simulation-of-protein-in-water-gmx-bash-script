Pre-requisites: You must have gromacs correctly and properly installed in your Linux system.
Check the path of Gromacs by using command: gmx pdb2gmx --version (in some cases, replace "gmx" with "gmx_mpi"). Edit the script.sh file to include the path where gromacs is installed in your system.
Run the command: "chmod +x script.sh", and then "./script.sh".
